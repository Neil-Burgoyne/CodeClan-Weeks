Class Diagrams

My class diagram show an overview of a book system and what data is required for each book.

Class diagrams are used to help visualize the structure of our code. They are a blueprint of the software you are developing.

It shows the entire program, and how each part relates to one another.

Object Diagrams

For my object diagram I showed the information for a book. The program would show the title, price, author and publisher. When adding new books, these are the fields required. It shows what information will be presented when showing an individual book.

Object diagrams show an instance of a class diagram, what the program will show about the class instance when the software is running.
